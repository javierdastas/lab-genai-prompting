       "8. **Disable VPN or Proxy**: If you are using a VPN or proxy, try disabling it and see if that resolves the issue, as some sites may restrict access from certain IP addresses.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **Check File Name**: Ensure that your PDF file name doesn’t contain any special characters or spaces. A simple name (e.g., \"Resume.pdf\") is recommended.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Browser Compatibility**: Sometimes, certain browsers can cause issues with uploads. Try using a different browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) or clear your current browser's cache and cookies.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **File Size and Format**: While you mentioned that your file is below the size limit and in PDF format, please confirm that the file is not corrupted. You could try opening the PDF on your device to ensure it displays correctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Internet Connection**: Ensure that your internet connection is stable. A weak connection may interrupt the upload process.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Try a Different Device**: If possible, try to upload your resume from a different device to see if the issue persists.\n",
       "\n",
       "If you’ve tried these steps and are still encountering difficulties, please let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist you further.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. **File Name Check**: Ensure your PDF file name is simple and does not include any special characters, spaces, or long titles. A name like \"Resume.pdf\" works best.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Browser Compatibility**:\n",
       "   - Use a modern browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari. \n",
       "   - If you are already using one of these, try updating it to the latest version.\n",
       "   - Clear your browser's cache and cookies by going to the settings menu, which can often resolve upload issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **File Size and Format**:\n",
       "   - Confirm that your PDF file is under the maximum size limit specified on our upload page. \n",
       "   - Ensure the file is not corrupted by opening it on your device. If it doesn’t open or displays errors, try creating a new PDF.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Internet Connection**:\n",
       "   - Check your internet connection's stability. If possible, switch to a wired connection or a different Wi-Fi network to improve upload reliability.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Disabling Browser Extensions**: Sometimes, browser extensions can interfere with uploads. Try disabling any extensions, especially ad blockers or script blockers, and attempt the upload again.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Using Incognito/Private Mode**: Open your browser in incognito or private mode (usually accessible through the browser menu) and try uploading your resume again. This mode can help bypass certain settings that may be causing issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Alternative Device**: If you have access to another device (like a smartphone or tablet), attempt the upload from there to see if the problem persists.\n",
